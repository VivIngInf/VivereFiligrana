# Vivere Filigrana - Document Conversion and Watermarking Tool 🔏

## Language Toggle

[🇮🇹 Italiano](./resources/docs/README-italian.md) | [🇬🇧 English](#)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Vivere Ateneo document conversion and watermarking tool: Vivere Filigrana!

This website allows users to convert `.docx` files into `.pdf` and apply a watermark with the Vivere Ateneo logo and its sub-associations.

Additionally, users can directly upload `.pdf` files, and the tool will apply the watermark to them.

## Project Structure

Here is the directory structure of the project:

```

## Requirements

Before running this project, you need to install the following:

- **LibreOffice (headless)**: This is required for converting `.docx` files to `.pdf` format. 

To install LibreOffice on Ubuntu, use the following command:
    
``` shell
sudo apt install libreoffice
```

- **Python environment**:

1. Create a virtual environment (venv) in the source directory:

``` shell
    python -m venv venv
```
    
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    
``` shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **npm (development only)**: Please note that npm is only used during development for building css styles and is not required for deployment.

``` shell
    npm run watch
```

## Running the Application

Once you have installed all dependencies and set up the environment, you can run the application with the following command:

``` shell
    python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server locally. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.

## Building and serving the Application

Building the Application

To build the project as a Python wheel, first install the build tools:
```shell
    pipx install hatch
    pip install build
```

Then, from the project root, build the wheel:

```shell
	python -m build --wheel
```

The resulting .whl file will be placed in the dist/ directory and can be installed with pip:
```shell
   pip install dist/<package-name>.whl.
```

Then you can use something like gunicorn to expose it to the internet:

```shell
	#!/usr/bin/bash
	gunicorn vivere_filigrana:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```
